# Dockerized Campus IdP platform

This document briefly describes dockerized _Campus IdP_ platform. It has been developed and tested using `Docker version 18.03.1-ce` and `docker-compose version 1.21.2` so make sure you are using at least the versions mentioned.

The primary way to run this is to use `docker-compose` command, but prior to this one has to prepare a few configuration files and load a few variables into the terminal.

## debian:stretch-slim

Using `debian:stretch` official Debian Docker image produces an image 339MB in size. There is also `debian:stretch-slim`, which is 45 MB smaller compared to `debian:stretch`. In case such saving is reasonable for you, you can switch to _slim_ image. In that case you need to change first line of `Dockerfile` and also put `mkdir -p /usr/share/man/man1` right before `apt-get install` command due to a [reported bug][].

| Docker image          | Size  |
| --------------------- | -----:|
| `debian:stretch`      | 339MB |
| `debian:stretch-slim` | 286MB |
| `mysql:5`             | 372MB |
| `mariadb:10.1`        | 407MB |

Althoug, MySQL container for storing `persistent-id` (aka `eduPersonTargetedID` attribute) consumes _372MB_, saving 53MB could make a difference for someone.

It could be saved 48MB by deleting `/opt/shibboleth-identity-provider-$SHIBBOLETH_VERSION/` directory which is not neccessary after it has been installed using `install.sh` script. However, that assumes the installation is run from the `Dockerfile` not `docker-entrypoint.sh`. And I am sure it is not worth it.

## MySQL or MariaDB

Although the current `docker-compose.yml` deploys MySQL (`mysql:5`), it has been tested with MariaDB (`mariadb:10.1`) as well. Just tweak `docker-compose.yml` as follows:

```
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.1
    hostname: mariadb
```

## Configure an IdP

Prior to running an IdP, two configuration files must be prepared.

FIXME: `JETTY_VERSION` and `SHIBBOLETH_VERSION`.

### idp.conf

In this file, which is loaded automatically by `docker-compose.yml`, all "internal" configuration for the IdP itself is defined. These variables are not required for building the image, these are required only when `docker-entrypoint.sh` is run to configure installed IdP. There are various passwords mostly, however, you can define _scope_ and _entityID_ for the IdP etc.


```
JETTY_CERT_KEY=iemooP4mu3neuPhiequi

```

### db.conf

This file contains all database stuff, such as root password, database name, etc. Database is used for storing attribute release consents and computed persistent-ids.

```
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=shie9aez5Ahzakah9aen
MYSQL_DATABASE=shibboleth
MYSQL_USER=shibboleth
MYSQL_PASSWORD=miehaiph3chohghoaXah
```

## Run an IdP

In order to run an IdP a variable $HOST must be defined and its value is expected to be the subdirectory name under `conf/` directory where all configuration (IdP and database) is defined. Either `export HOST` variable or type `HOST` variable at the beginning of `docker-compose` command.

### Start your IdP

Now it is possible to run `docker-compose` command. It is a very good idea to specify "a project name" using `-p` parameter. I would use domain name or server host name as a value.

```bash
HOST=idp.example.org docker-compose -p example up -d --build
```

## Stop an IdP

To shut down the IdP including database, run:

```bash
docker-compose -p example down
```

### Stop and deleting everything

To stop and delete running container, delete all built images and data volumes, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -p example down --rmi local -v --remove-orphans
```

Using `all` argument for `--rmi` option would delete even images downloaded from internet. You do not want to use that since it just waste bandwidth on both sided.
